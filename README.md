## Overview

### Screenshot

![My solution for all screen sizes](./progress_documentation/all_screens_result.png)

<!-- Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.** -->

## My process

- Checkout the [LiveStreams on Twitch from 22th and 23th April 2022](twitch.tv/sammeeey/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
<!-- - Flexbox
- CSS Grid -->
- Mobile-first workflow
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

<!-- **Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices** -->

### What I learned

- basic practice and workflow with HTML and Sass for frontend design
  - derived from [Gary Simon's Crash Course](https://github.com/Sammeeey/HTML-CSS-CrashCourse-2021/)
- when to **not** work with media queriesðŸ˜…
- when to use absolute/relative scales

started design with relative width for QR card,
```
.card {
    max-width: 85vw;
}
```
which resulted in increasing card size on increasing screens.

Hence, switched to absolute scale:
```
.card {
    width: 318px;
}
```

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
} 
```

Great thanks to all the people who followed my process on Twitch or Twitter - even now in the beginning where I obviously still suckâ™¥ðŸ¤—
